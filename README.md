react-firebase-auth
=================

This is a just a simple react app with a log in. You can [demo it on glitch](https://react-firebase-auth.glitch.me).


Get Started
------------

```
npm run start
```
Will build a dev bundle and start the dev server.

```
npm run build
```
Will build a production bundle.

---

This is just a starter react project for front end log in and log out. For example, it can be used to start a membership react application that needs authenticated routes to be hidden, and a way to log in, log out and register users.

It uses [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for email and password authentication.

I've used [bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/) but this can be replaced with another framework or custom css.
